<li>Everything that happens is just a link in a great chain of happenings. 
</li><br>
<li>Everything you do today is for the future. 
</li><br>

<li>Influencing how we imagine the world should become the focus of our endeavours. 
</li><br>

</li><br>

</li><br>
<li>There is an unseen order, and our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto. 
</li><br>
<li>His flaws are fractal, even his flaws have flaws. 
</li><br>
<li>We become what we do: it is our behavior that determines the contents of our mind. 
</li><br>
<li>Because change is an uncomfortable choice, people try anything to get change without change. 
</li><br>
<li>Feelings follow behavior. 
</li><br>
<li>Be weird. Unapologetically weird. 
</li><br>
<li>I am just a character in the story. And the story fucking sucks. 
</li><br>

</li><br>

</li><br>
<li>Comfort makes cowards of us all. 
</li><br>
<li>Being right is nothing but grief. 
</li><br>
<li>By balancing your life you postpone nothing: you can die happy at any time. 
</li><br>
<li>Be grateful for the mere absence of catastrophe. 
</li><br>
<li>The easiest way to change your mood is to change your environment. 
</li><br>
<li>What horrifies me most is the idea of being useless: well-educated, brilliantly promising, and fading out into an indifferent middle age. 
</li><br>
<li>Words are our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury and remedying it. 
</li><br>
<li>The intent to communicate honestly is the measure of truthfulness. 
</li><br>
<li>It is in believing one thing while intending to communicate another that every lie is born. 
</li><br>
<li>Inspiration is perishable. Take action. 
</li><br>
<li>Mind is awareness in motion; awareness is mind at rest.
</li><br>
<li>Unhappiness is the veiling of happiness.
</li><br>
<li>What got you here won't get you there.
</li><br>

</li><br>
<li>I was born with an enormous need for affection and a terrible need to give it.

<li>There isn't anything more rewarding than trying to do things right, and there's nothing more adventurous than telling the truth. 
</li><br>
<li>Pain is an adhesive. 
</li><br>

</li><br>
<li>Aim for less but better. 
</li><br>
<li>Honesty is an engine of simplicity. 
</li><br>
<li>Today, well lived, makes yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope. 
</li><br>
<li>Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you.  
</li><br>
<li>In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts. 
</li><br>
<li>Our thoughts control our feelings. Our feelings control our actions. 
</li><br>
<li>When thought is no more, the passage of time is no more either. 
</li><br>
<li>Without the language to describe something, we cannot understand it. 
</li><br>
<li>Life is paradox, not contradiction. 
</li><br>

</li><br>
<li>All good things are wild and free. 
</li><br>
<li>Choose your regrets. Which ones can you live with?

</li><br>
<li>You will be notified. 
</li><br>
<li>The obstacle is the path.
</li><br>
<li>Your heroes are your idealized self. 
</li><br>
<li>I am the mate and companion of people all just as immortal and fathomless as myself. 
</li><br>
<li>A good life isn't an easy life. A good life makes you into a good person, and that is a hard life. 
</li><br>
<li>Doing nothing is the hardest work there is. 
</li><br>
<li>Strive to be better than yesterday. But remember to massively fuck up from time to time to reset the difficulty level. 
</li><br>
<li>Let me be water. Let me be water. Let me be water. 
</li><br>
<li>Fire was older than fear, and it held the truth. 
</li><br>
<li>Maybe beauty is truth without the filter of what the world thinks it should be.  
</li><br>
<li>Midlife is when you reach the top of the ladder and find that it was against the wrong wall.   
</li><br>

</li><br>
<li>A great life is just a series of great days.    
</li><br>

</li><br>

</li><br>
<li>Being a good person is easy. But being a person? That's fucking hard.  
</li><br>
<li>All roads lead to you. Even those I took to forget you.  
</li><br>

<li>You are made of stardust and poo particles. Don't get ahead of yourself.
</li><br>
<li>Choose discomfort over dissatisfaction. 
</li><br>
<li>The point isn't to make yourself feel that you're a part of everything, but to stop for one minute insisting that you're not. 
</li><br>
<li>A forma mais terrível de naufrágio é não partir. 
</li><br>

</li><br>

</li><br>
<li>Crecer es aprender a agradecer. 
</li><br>

<li>Deberías escucharme hablar de ti para que entiendas todo. 
</li><br>
<li>Las relaciones se construyen con momentos invisibles para el otro. 
</li><br>
<li>Una cosa es que le gustes, y otra muy distinta que le intereses. 
</li><br>
<li>No importa el tamaño del perro en la pelea, sino el tamaño de la pelea dentro del perro. 
</li><br>

</li><br>
<li>Los años que tienes, en realidad son los años que ya no tienes. 
</li><br>
<li>Es tiempo de entender más, para que temamos menos. 
</li><br>
<li>Hay que tomar lo que hay, cuando hay. 
</li><br>
<li>Aunque nada cambie, si yo cambio, todo cambia. 
</li><br>
<li>Nada es para tanto y nada es para siempre. 
</li><br>
<li>No fuimos ni somos ni seremos. Porque para ser hay que estar, y no quisimos ni ser, ni estar, ni querer. 
</li><br>
<li>Ni el aire de tus pulmones te pertenece más de tres segundos. 
</li><br>
<li>Ser, nunca es poquito. 
</li><br>
<li>Cuando la gente grita es que todo es posible todavía. 
</li><br>
<li>Lo importante te amenaza siempre a dos, a tres centímetros. 
</li><br>
<li>La felicidad nunca tiene grandeza. 
</li><br>
<li>Los ojos son para aceptar. No saben cómo hacer para oponerse. 
</li><br>
<li>Para recordarte feliz voy a tener que olvidarte. 
</li><br>
<li>Lo que definitivamente no soporto es cuando va y me entiende. 
</li><br>
<li>Contéstale que si porque de todas maneras te vas a arrepentir toda la vida si le contestas que no. 
</li><br>
<li>Mientras los diarios sigan abriendo con noticias negativas es que la cosa va bien. Porque lo noticiable es la excepción. 
</li><br>
<li>No entiendo la vida, pero sigo aquí porque me gusta comer. 
</li><br>
<li>No hay ideas originales. Cualquier idea es la suma inevitable de todas las ideas que existieron en el pasado. 
</li><br>
<li>Los planes deben tomar en cuenta que todo va a cambiar. 
</li><br>
<li>Somos la naturaleza creando nuevas formas.  
</li><br>
<li>Toma la decisión de irte en un buen día. No cuando la estés pasando mal. 
</li><br>
<li>Amar es dar lo que no se tiene a quien no es. 
</li><br>
<li>Acá todo podía suceder. Allá ya había sucedido casi todo. Como si la porción del azar ya se hubiera agotado. 
</li><br>
<li>La cercanía causa conflicto. 
</li><br>
<li>El universo premia la acción.  
</li><br>
<li>Nada tiene que ser difícil. Las cosas se complican cuando buscamos algo que no hay. 
</li><br>
<li>El amor es confiar en la casualidad. En la idea de que el mundo puede experimentarse desde el punto de vista de la diferencia. 
</li><br>
<li>Así se fija el azar: la absoluta contingencia del encuentro de alguien a quien yo no conocía termina tomando la apariencia de un destino.
